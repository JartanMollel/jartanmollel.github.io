This is a cute little website that is designed to wish a happy birthday to someone special named Arch. This website has been designed with HTML and CSS, and it uses a little bit of JavaScript to embed a YouTube video with the Youtube IFrame Player API.

The website has a beautiful background that repeats an video of one of Arch's animation creations which she did while she was on camp, which gives the site a nice personalised touch. The background also has a YouTube video embedded on it, which automatically starts playing as soon as you open the website.

The site also has a container with three sections: header, main, and footer. The header section has two large headings that wish a happy birthday to Arch. The main section has a message wishing Arch a happy birthday and thanking them for being an amazing person in the my life. The main section also has an image of Arch and a button accept their gift, (which is a giftcard). The footer section has a short thank you message for them being a part of the my life.

The website is mobile-responsive, which means it will look great on any device, be it a laptop, tablet, or phone.

All in all, this website is a beautiful and personalised way to wish Arch a happy birthday cause y'know, she desevers the world.
